        <h1> Poor/Poverty </h1>
        <p> An estimated 43.1 million Americans lived in poverty in 2016.Most people who are poor own computers, have cars and have bigger living quarters than a lot of people in other countries.More Americans owe more than what they own.Poverty rates are highest for families headed by single women, particularly if they are black or Hispanic.Most of these women have children and without the additional income from a spouse, they are at a greater risk of poverty.The U.S. spends 500 billion dollars a year to take care of these children.There are an estimated 15 million kids living with families below the poverty threshold.Families need to make twice of what they earn to support their children.Child poverty rates are highest among black, Latino and American Indian children.Older adults struggle to keep up with rising housing costs, rising health care bills, rising utility costs and don't have enough in savings to carry them through. Some can't even keep their heat on and don't have enough food to eat. There are over 20 million Americans who are over the age of 60 and they are living below the federal poverty level due to being on a fixed income. There are an estimated 6.4 million seniors living in poverty in America and it is on the rise. </p>
